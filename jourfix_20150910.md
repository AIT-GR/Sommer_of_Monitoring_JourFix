# Jour fix 2015-09-10
Nils is at AIT


## New member
Milosh, from TU, working with data and linked data


## Log from last time

### Undelete/Recovery
no undo for accidentally deleted objects

- Usecase: undo button to undelete the last delete
- Usecase: undelete random objects

Idea: List of changs, a log

Watch out for Unique-objects

### Class import/export
exprort from one JEVis instance and transfered over email, usb etc, and then import it into another JEVis-instance

In the future import a JEDataCollector-Driver with just one file

at the moment no depencency resolving, just the stuff that is in the file

Watch out: dependencies and conflicts can be very complicated


#### Data Processing
same principle for DataProcessing

## JEDataCollector - Driver reimplementation
when reimplementation is done then the Drivers are uploaded into JEVis-database

Feature request: for development and testing tell the datacollector to use a local driver, maybe already there

## Verbindungsprobleme JEConfig - Bilal
Nachdem Laptop in den Standby geht glaubt JEConfig, dass JEConfig noch immer verbunden ist, aber trotzdem nicht wirklich verbunden

## Store Metadata
Howto store information of nodes (location or other data)

Currently stored fix in tree

currently information for a node can be defined by its class and stored in attributes

no querying-capabilities

It should be possible to add meta-information to any object. No need to change the class.

Nils Usecase: something like a hashtag, Metainfo-directory, where we add meta-information. Based on relations link to this meta-information-object. Later a Hashtag-search-engine can search for these meta-information-object.

Milosh and Max will define a specific usecase

mentioned RDF and sparkle engine

ein Spezialist im bereich von Semantic Data sollte dabei sein

Feature f√ºr die ferne Zukunft

## JEDataProcessor
is worked on, linking tasks
